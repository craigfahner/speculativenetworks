## Workshop 3: Ante-Social Website

You will work with another student to conduct a user study and walkthrough of an app you have chosen. Ideally you are selecting an app that at least one of your group members is not already familiar with, so that they can narrate their experience of the app for the user study without prior knowledge of its design. Please do the user study first, and then work together to document the app’s design more comprehensively using the walkthrough method. Assemble your findings in a simple presentation (Google Slides).

### Required software

**Github Desktop**

GitHub provides the infrastructure for this course. It is how I will share assignments and examples with you, and it is how you will submit your own notes and assignments. It also allows you to publish your content to the web easily through something called GitHub Pages.

1. Sign up for a new [GitHub](https://github.com) account. If you already have one, you can either use your existing account or sign up for a new, course-specific account. ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVRuPO8nCLA)).
2. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN5A0kDdCwk)).
3. Log into your new GitHub account from GitHub desktop.

**VSCode**

VSCode is the code editor we will be using in this class. It is essentially a fancy text editor that is streamlined for editing code. While you can technically edit code in any basic text editor, VSCode is nice because it can auto-format your code, it color-codes different elements of your code, and you can preview what you're working on in the editor.

1. [Download VSCode here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install VSCode
3. Open VSCode and install these three extensions
- [Live Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

The easiest way to install extensions is to click on the extension icon in the code editor, and to search for the extensions by name, after which you can click the "install" button. ([video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bwj703QNU9L762EmWsm-hQ_Cl-vl6Nov/view?usp=sharing))

### Activity

The assignment is to create an intentionally “bad” website, using GeoCities personal websites from the 1990s / early 2000s as inspiration. The point of this exercise is to reflect on the possibilities for self-expression and experimentation represented by web 1.0 personal websites, and to consider how this kind of creativity and experimentation might be applied in a contemporary context.

Consider the following questions as you create your project:
- How did notions of identity, community and cultural expression play out on the early web?
- How does the early web differ from the social media era? What can we learn from the early web in thinking about how to design better social media?
- Why does everything look the same now? Is sameness preferable to amateur self-expression? How can user agency play a bigger role in the look and feel of the web?
- What happens if we dispense of the design stereotypes of the contemporary web? How can we make design more playful and inviting?
- Instead of “platforms” how might web-based media appear as: utopias? Hotels? Museums? Nightclubs? Memorials? Haunted houses? What other metaphors might we start with?

You may choose three different approaches for the content of your Web 1.0 website:

- Create a personal website based on a “persona” of a person living in the mid-to-late 90s, who is excited about the possibilities of the Internet. What are the hopes and dreams of this person, related to digital communication? What do the possibilities represented by personal website publishing mean to them? As you research sites from this time period, you will find many are related to specific special interests. Give your persona a special interest that explored through the pages of your site. Think of this page as the Web 1.0 equivalent of a social media profile, and use the affordances of the Geocities-style website to express your persona’s identity in ways that might not be possible within the affordances of contemporary social media.
- You have just finished your Speculative Design project for this class. Imagine if this technology existed in the Web 1.0 era. How would it be different? How might it be communicated to an audience not already familiar with social media and mobile computing? Create a “retro-futurist” rendering of your speculative design idea.
- As a third option, create an experimental, “net-art” style website that uses hyperlinks to create a non-linear narrative or to showcase absurd, experimental content. References to 1990s “net-art” will be necessary in your writeup if you choose this option, so be sure to research some examples of net-art as part of your process.
